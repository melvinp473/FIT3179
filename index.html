    <h1>Education in Australia</h1>
    <div class="subheading-div">
        <p>In the land down under, education stands as a cornerstone of society, shaping the minds of future generations
            and driving innovation forward. Recent data from Australian schools paints a vivid picture of how education
            is distributed and how it's evolving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="curved-box-container">
        <div class="curved-box" id="vis">
            <h2>School Count</h2>
            <div id="paired_column"></div>
            <div class="text-div">
                <p>
                    Firstly, school counts by state and territory reveal significant differences across the country. New
                    South Wales, with its sprawling urban centres, leads the pack with <strong>3,125</strong> schools,
                    while the Northern Territory, with its vast and sparsely populated areas, has far fewer schools. The
                    Australian Capital Territory, being a smaller territory, has the least, with only
                    <strong>137</strong> schools.

            <h2>Student Enrolments</h2>
            <div id="chloropleth"></div>
            <div class="text-div">
                <p>Delving into student enrolment, a snapshot from <u>2023</u> shows a diverse landscape. States like
                    Victoria and New South Wales have high numbers of student enrolments, with both states having more
                    than <strong>1 million</strong> enrolments, reflecting their larger populations.

            <h2>Overseas Student Enrolments</h2>
            <div id="heatmap"></div>
            <div class="text-div">
                <p>One intriguing aspect of this educational tapestry is the presence of full-fee-paying overseas
                    students. From <u>2019</u> to <u>2023</u>, these enrolments provide insight into Australia's global
                    appeal as an education hub. States like Victoria and New South Wales attract a significant number of
                    these students, with Victoria recording <strong>10,499</strong> overseas enrolments in <u>2019</u>,
                    the highest recorded, underscoring their strong international reputation.</p>

            <div class="text-div">
                <p>Finally, the proportion of enrolments by school affiliation over time reveals shifting trends. Since
                    <u>2006</u>, there has been a gradual increase in enrolments in independent schools, with enrolments
                    growing by <strong>3.3%</strong>, hinting at a growing demand for alternative education options.
